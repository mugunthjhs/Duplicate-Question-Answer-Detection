The curvature causes rays from different angles to be reflected toward the observer. This allows shopkeepers to monitor large areas through a single mirror mounted at an elevated point.

To burn paper, the lens must be held so that the paper lies exactly at the focus of the lens. This is where parallel rays of sunlight converge after passing through the lens. At this point, the light’s energy is concentrated, increasing the temperature. If the lens has a short focal length, the heat is more intense.

Adjust the distance between the paper and the lens until a sharp, bright spot (image of the Sun) appears on  the paper. Measure the distance from the lens to the paper; this is the focal length of the lens.

As light rays pass from water (denser medium) to air (rarer medium), they bend away from the normal.

As it passes from glass to water, it bends away from the normal, since water is optically less dense than glass. The overall bending depends on the refractive indices of the materials. Each change in medium causes the ray to change direction due to variation in light speed. The final emergent ray depends on the relative optical densities.",

A convex lens helps by converging the incoming light rays before they enter the eye, so they focus on the retina instead of behind it.

The concave mirror not only concentrates the light onto a small area (focusing property) but also allows the doctor to see an enlarged, upright image of the affected region. Because the mirror is mounted with a central hole (for the doctor's eye), it combines illumination and magnification. The image appears behind the mirror, making internal structures more visible without distortion. This setup improves precision in diagnosis and treatment.

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "An object under water appears raised because of refraction at the water air interface. Light rays coming from the object bend away from the normal as they move from water (denser) to air (rarer). Due to this, the brain traces the refracted rays in a straight line backward, perceiving the object at a shallower depth — this is called apparent depth. The relationship is: Apparent depth / Real depth = 1 / Refractive index So, if the refractive index of water is 4/3 and real depth is 12 cm, the object appears at 9 cm. This phenomenon has practical implications in activities like spearfishing, where one has to aim below the apparent position of the fish to hit the real target. It also explains why swimming pool bottoms look closer than they are.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Convex mirrors are used in ATMs, elevators, and hallways because they provide a wide field of view. Their outward-curved surface reflects light rays in such a way that they appear to diverge from a point behind the mirror. This results in the formation of virtual, erect, and diminished images — though smaller, they cover a larger area. This allows users and security personnel to monitor surroundings and check for safety, especially in blind corners. Due to the mirror's geometry, even a small convex mirror can display wide angle views, making it ideal for areas with limited space. The image is not distorted and allows real-time monitoring of people approaching or standing nearby. In elevators, these mirrors help passengers see who is behind them, reducing risks and improving security.",

                "Refraction, Lens, Microscope, Telescope, Optical instruments, Convex lens, Real image, Converging rays, Eyepiece, Objective lens"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Refraction is the key principle in the functioning of optical instruments such as microscopes, telescopes, cameras, and magnifiers. When light passes from one medium to another (e.g., air to glass), it changes direction — this is refraction. In a convex lens, parallel rays converge at the focus, forming real, inverted images which can be projected or magnified. In microscopes, two or more convex lenses are used: the objective lens forms a real image which is magnified again by the eyepiece. In telescopes, lenses or mirrors gather distant light and refract it to form a real image, which is magnified. This is possible only because the materials (glass/plastic) are optically denser, allowing light to slow down and bend inside them. Careful design using the lens maker’s formula and understanding of refraction allows accurate image formation and magnification.",

            "question": "Justify why the image of the sun formed by a convex lens on a paper is real and inverted. How does the lens behave in this context?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "The Sun’s rays are effectively parallel when they reach the Earth due to its large distance. When these rays pass through a convex lens, they converge at the principal focus, forming a real image on the paper. This real image is inverted (though the Sun appears circular) and can even burn the paper due to energy concentration. The lens in this scenario is acting as a converging lens, converting parallel rays into focused rays meeting at a point. The image is visible because the light rays actually meet at the focal point. This principle is also applied in solar concentrators, which use convex lenses to convert solar energy into heat energy. Such real images can only be captured on a screen, proving their physical existence.",
