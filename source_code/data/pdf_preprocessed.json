        "correctAnswer": "A convex mirror always forms a virtual, erect, and diminished image of\nobjects, regardless of their position. Its most important feature is that it\nprovides a wider field of view than any other type of mirror, which is\nessential for surveillance. The curvature causes rays from different angles\nto be reflected toward the observer. This allows shopkeepers to monitor\nlarge areas through a single mirror mounted at an elevated point. Though\nthe image is small, it is sufficient for detection of movement or presence.",

To burn paper, the lens must be held so that the paper lies exactly at\nthe focus of the lens. This is where parallel rays of sunlight converge after\npassing through the lens.

        "correctAnswer": "A real image is formed when light rays actually converge at a point after\nreflection or refraction. Since the rays meet at a physical location, the\nimage can be projected onto a screen. A virtual image, on the other hand,\nis formed when the rays only appear to meet but don’t actually intersect.\nTherefore, virtual images cannot be projected or captured on a screen;\nthey can only be seen by looking into the optical device.",
