ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS WITH TWO OR THREE SENTENCES

151. Explain with a ray diagram how a concave mirror forms a real,
inverted and magnified image when the object is placed between F and
C.
-----------------------------
Answer:
When an object is placed between the focus (F) and the centre of
curvature (C) of a concave mirror, a real, inverted and enlarged image is
formed beyond C. A ray parallel to the principal axis reflects through the
focus, and a ray passing through the centre of curvature reflects back on
itself. These rays intersect beyond C, forming the required image. The
image is real because the rays actually meet, it is inverted, and it is larger
than the object because it lies farther from the mirror than the object. This
principle is used in devices like solar concentrators and makeup mirrors.

152. Define the principal focus of a concave mirror. Draw a ray diagram to
show how light rays converge at the focus.
-----------------------------
Answer:
The principal focus of a concave mirror is the point on the principal axis
where light rays parallel to the axis converge after reflection from the
mirror surface. For a concave mirror, this point lies in front of the mirror. To
show this, several rays parallel to the principal axis are drawn incident on
the mirror; after reflection, all pass through the focus. The diagram clearly
illustrates convergence due to the curved surface. This principle is
important in designing satellite dishes and telescopes.

153. An object 2 cm high is placed at 12 cm in front of a concave mirror of
focal length 8 cm. Use mirror formula to find the position, nature and size
of the image.
-----------------------------
Answer:
Using the mirror formula:
1/f = 1/v + 1/u
Given: f = –8 cm, u = –12 cm
1/v = 1/–8 – 1/–12 = (–3 + 2)/24 = –1/24 → v = –24 cm
The negative sign means the image is formed on the same side as the
object, which means it is real.
Magnification m = –v/u = –(–24)/(–12) = –2 → image height = m × object
height = –2 × 2 = –4 cm
So, the image is real, inverted and magnified 2 times.

154. Explain how refraction occurs at the boundary between two media
with a labelled diagram.
-----------------------------
Answer:
Refraction is the bending of light as it travels from one medium to another
with different optical densities. It occurs because light travels at different
speeds in different media. When light enters a denser medium (like air to
glass), it bends towards the normal; when it enters a rarer medium (glass
to air), it bends away from the normal. The degree of bending depends on
the refractive index. This phenomenon is demonstrated with a diagram
showing incident, refracted and emergent rays at the interface of two
media.

155. A ray of light passes through a rectangular glass slab. Explain with
diagram why the emergent ray is parallel to the incident ray.
-----------------------------
Answer:
When a light ray passes through a rectangular glass slab, it is refracted at
both air-glass and glass-air interfaces. At the first surface, it bends
towards the normal (as it enters denser medium), and at the second
surface, it bends away (as it exits to rarer medium). The overall effect is
lateral displacement, but the emergent ray is parallel to the incident ray.
This is because the two refractions are equal and opposite. A diagram of
the slab shows the bending and parallel emergent ray.

156. A convex lens of focal length 20 cm forms an image of an object
placed 30 cm from the lens. Find the image position and nature of image.
-----------------------------
Answer:
Using the lens formula: 1/f = 1/v – 1/u
Given: f = +20 cm, u = –30 cm
1/v = 1/20 + 1/30 = (3 + 2)/60 = 5/60 → v = 12 cm
The positive value of v means the image is formed on the opposite side of
the lens.
Magnification m = v/u = 12/(–30) = –0.4
Thus, the image is real, inverted and diminished in size.

159. Draw a ray diagram to show the image formation by a convex lens
when the object is at 2F. Describe the nature, size and position of the
image.
-----------------------------
Answer:
When the object is placed at 2F (twice the focal length) in front of a convex
lens, the image is formed at 2F on the opposite side. The image is real,
inverted, and same size as the object. The diagram includes a ray parallel
to the principal axis (passing through F after refraction) and a ray through
the optical centre (which passes undeviated). These rays meet at 2F
forming the image.

161. A convex mirror is used for security in shops. Explain how its image
characteristics make it suitable for this use.
-----------------------------
Answer:
A convex mirror always forms a virtual, erect, and diminished image of
objects, regardless of their position. Its most important feature is that it
provides a wider field of view than any other type of mirror, which is
essential for surveillance. The curvature causes rays from different angles
to be reflected toward the observer. This allows shopkeepers to monitor
large areas through a single mirror mounted at an elevated point. Though
the image is small, it is sufficient for detection of movement or presence.

162. An object is placed at a distance of 10 cm from a concave mirror with
focal length 15 cm. Find the position and nature of the image.
-----------------------------
Answer:
Using the mirror formula:
1/f = 1/v + 1/u → f = –15 cm, u = –10 cm
1/v = 1/–15 – 1/–10 = (–2 + 3)/30 = 1/30 → v = +30 cm
Since the image distance (v) is positive, it indicates that the image is
formed behind the mirror, and is therefore virtual. Also, magnification m = –
v/u = –30/(–10) = +3, so the image is magnified and erect.

163. How can you use a convex lens to burn a paper? Explain with reason
and conditions required.
-----------------------------
Answer:
A convex lens can focus sunlight to a single point known as the principal
focus. To burn paper, the lens must be held so that the paper lies exactly at
the focus of the lens. This is where parallel rays of sunlight converge after
passing through the lens. At this point, the light’s energy is concentrated,
increasing the temperature. If the lens has a short focal length, the heat is
more intense. The process demonstrates the converging property of
convex lenses.

164. A student wants to use a concave mirror as a shaving mirror. At what
position should he keep his face and why?
-----------------------------
Answer:
To use a concave mirror for shaving, the object (face) must be placed
between the pole (P) and focus (F) of the mirror. In this position, the mirror
forms an image that is virtual, erect, and magnified. This is suitable for
grooming purposes because it allows clear and enlarged view of facial
features. If the object were beyond focus, the image would be real and
inverted, which is not useful.

165. Design a method to determine the focal length of a convex lens using
sunlight.
-----------------------------
Answer:
To determine the focal length of a convex lens, place the lens in direct
sunlight and hold a white paper behind it. Adjust the distance between the
paper and the lens until a sharp, bright spot (image of the Sun) appears on
the paper. Measure the distance from the lens to the paper; this is the focal
length of the lens. This works because sunlight consists of parallel rays
which converge at the focal point after passing through the convex lens.

166. A 5 cm high object is placed at 25 cm from a convex lens of focal
length 10 cm. Calculate image distance, magnification and describe the
image.
-----------------------------
Answer:
Given: u = –25 cm, f = +10 cm
Using lens formula: 1/v = 1/f + 1/u = 1/10 – 1/25 = (5 – 2)/50 = 3/50 → v = 16.7
cm
Magnification m = v/u = 16.7/–25 = –0.67
Image height = m × object height = –0.67 × 5 = –3.35 cm
Hence, the image is real, inverted and smaller in size than the object.

167. Explain why a coin in water appears to be raised. Support your
answer with refraction concepts.
-----------------------------
Answer:
A coin placed at the bottom of a glass filled with water appears raised due
to the refraction of light. As light rays pass from water (denser medium) to
air (rarer medium), they bend away from the normal. Our brain assumes
light travels in a straight line, so it traces the rays back in a straight path,
making the object appear at a higher position than it really is. This is a
common example of optical illusion caused by refraction.

168. How does lateral shift occur in a glass slab? Explain with a diagram-
based explanation.
-----------------------------
Answer:
Lateral shift is the sideways displacement of a light ray as it passes
through a rectangular glass slab. When a ray enters the glass from air, it
bends towards the normal due to refraction. When it exits the slab, it bends
away from the normal. The emergent ray is parallel to the incident ray but
displaced laterally. The amount of shift depends on the thickness of the
slab and angle of incidence.

169. A ray of light enters from air into glass and then into water. Describe
the path of light with justification.
-----------------------------
Answer:
When a ray of light enters from air into glass, it bends towards the normal
because glass is denser. As it passes from glass to water, it bends away
from the normal, since water is optically less dense than glass. The overall
bending depends on the refractive indices of the materials. Each change in
medium causes the ray to change direction due to variation in light speed.
The final emergent ray depends on the relative optical densities.

170. A convex mirror gives a virtual image at a distance of 10 cm behind
the mirror. The object is placed 30 cm in front. Calculate the focal length.
-----------------------------
Answer:
Using mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u
Given: v = +10 cm (virtual image), u = –30 cm
1/f = 1/10 – 1/30 = (3 – 1)/30 = 2/30 = 1/15 → f = 15 cm
Since it is a convex mirror, focal length = +15 cm
Hence, the mirror has a focal length of +15 cm and forms a virtual, erect,
diminished image.

171. Justify why convex lenses are used in spectacles for hypermetropia.
-----------------------------
Answer:
Hypermetropia or farsightedness occurs when the image of a nearby
object forms behind the retina. This happens when the eye lens is too flat
or the eyeball is too short. A convex lens converges light rays before they
enter the eye, so they are focused correctly on the retina. The converging
nature of the convex lens compensates for the eye’s weak focusing power.
Keywords: Hypermetropia, Convex lens, Farsightedness, Spectacles,
Image correction, Retina

172. Explain how a convex lens acts as a magnifying glass. Under what
conditions does this occur?
-----------------------------
Answer:
A convex lens acts as a magnifying glass when the object is placed
between the lens and its focus. In this position, the lens forms a virtual,
erect and magnified image on the same side of the lens. The lens must be
held close to the object and the viewer’s eye. This is used in magnifiers,
watches, and reading glasses to observe small details.

173. Describe the image formation by a concave lens using ray diagrams
for any object distance.
-----------------------------
Answer:
A concave lens always forms a virtual, erect and diminished image
irrespective of the object’s distance. One ray parallel to the principal axis
diverges after refraction and appears to come from the focus. Another ray
passes undeviated through the optical centre. These rays diverge, but
when extended backward, they appear to meet at a point on the same
side as the object.

174. Why does light bend at the interface of two different media? Explain
using the wave speed concept.
-----------------------------
Answer:
Light bends at the interface of two media due to a change in its speed.
When light enters a medium with different optical density, its velocity
changes, causing the direction to change. If it enters a denser medium, it
slows down and bends toward the normal. If it enters a rarer medium, it
speeds up and bends away from the normal. This bending is called
refraction and is explained by Snell’s law.

175. A convex lens forms an image of the same size as the object. Find the
object position and explain with a diagram.
-----------------------------
Answer:
A convex lens forms an image of the same size when the object is placed
at 2F. The image is formed on the opposite side at 2F. It is real, inverted and
of equal size. The ray diagram shows one ray parallel to the axis passing
through focus and one passing through the optical centre, intersecting at
2F.

176. A driver uses a convex mirror as a side mirror. Justify why this is
better than using a plane or concave mirror.
-----------------------------
Answer:
Convex mirrors are preferred for side mirrors in vehicles because they
provide a wider field of view. This allows the driver to see more of the road
and surrounding area, improving safety. Unlike concave mirrors, convex
mirrors do not invert the image and always provide an upright, virtual and
diminished image. This makes them useful for detecting nearby vehicles
without confusion. Plane mirrors, in contrast, offer a limited field of view and
cannot cover blind spots.

177. A spoon appears distorted when placed in a glass of water. Justify
your observation using refraction.
-----------------------------
Answer:
When a spoon is partially submerged in water, the part inside appears
bent or displaced. This is due to the refraction of light as it moves from
water to air. The light rays coming from the submerged portion bend away
from the normal, causing the apparent position to shift. Our eyes trace
back the refracted rays in a straight line, resulting in a visually distorted
image. The effect is more noticeable at oblique viewing angles.

178. While looking into a concave mirror, your face appears magnified
and upright. Justify how this happens.
-----------------------------
Answer:
When your face is close to a concave mirror, specifically between the pole
and the focus, the reflected rays diverge but appear to originate from a
point behind the mirror. This forms a virtual, erect and magnified image.
The mirror's inward curvature causes rays to reflect in a way that produces
this enlargement. This property is used in shaving and makeup mirrors,
where a detailed view of the face is needed.

179. Why is a convex lens used in reading glasses for old-age
hypermetropic people? Justify your answer.
-----------------------------
Answer:
With age, the eye lens loses flexibility and cannot converge light rays from
nearby objects effectively. This condition is called hypermetropia. A convex
lens helps by converging the incoming light rays before they enter the eye,
so they focus on the retina instead of behind it. The lens compensates for
the weak accommodation power of the eye. This allows the person to see
nearby objects clearly.

glasses, Retina

180. A glass slab does not deviate the emergent ray from the original
path. Justify how this happens.
-----------------------------
Answer:
When light passes through a rectangular glass slab, it refracts twice: once
when entering and once when leaving. The first refraction bends the ray
toward the normal, and the second bends it away from the normal. The
two deviations cancel each other out, and the emergent ray becomes
parallel to the incident ray, though it undergoes lateral shift. This behavior
is unique to rectangular slabs due to their parallel sides.

181. Why does a convex lens form a virtual and enlarged image only when
the object is closer than the focal length?
-----------------------------
Answer:
A convex lens can only form a virtual and enlarged image when the object
is placed between the optical centre and the focal point. In this case, the
rays diverge after refraction and do not meet on the other side of the lens.
However, if extended backward, they appear to come from a point behind
the lens. This makes the image virtual and larger. Beyond the focal length,
the lens forms real and inverted images.

182. While looking at a fish in a pond, it appears at a different location
than it actually is. Justify.
-----------------------------
Answer:
This is due to the refraction of light at the water-air interface. The light rays
coming from the fish bend away from the normal as they pass into air. Our
brain traces the rays in a straight line, placing the image of the fish at a
higher, incorrect position. As a result, the fish appears closer to the surface
than it actually is. This is a classic example of apparent depth caused by
refraction.

183. A magnifying glass must be held close to an object to work. Justify
the reason based on lens behavior.
-----------------------------
Answer:
A magnifying glass is a convex lens used to produce a virtual and enlarged
image of a small object. For this to happen, the object must be placed
between the lens and its focal point. At this distance, the rays diverge after
refraction and appear to come from a larger image on the same side as
the object. Holding the lens close ensures a bigger virtual image, which is
essential for reading or examining fine details.

184. Explain why a concave mirror is used in solar concentrators. Justify
your answer with light behavior.

as the focus. In solar concentrators, this property is used to collect and
concentrate solar energy at a point to produce high temperatures. The
mirror’s parabolic shape ensures that all incoming sunlight is reflected and
converged efficiently. This concentrated energy can be used for heating,
cooking or generating steam.

185. A real image can be captured on a screen, but a virtual one cannot.
Justify with reference to ray behavior.
-----------------------------
Answer:
A real image is formed when light rays actually converge at a point after
reflection or refraction. Since the rays meet at a physical location, the
image can be projected onto a screen. A virtual image, on the other hand,
is formed when the rays only appear to meet but don’t actually intersect.
Therefore, virtual images cannot be projected or captured on a screen;
they can only be seen by looking into the optical device.

186. With the help of ray diagrams, explain the image formation by a
concave mirror for various positions of the object.
-----------------------------
Answer:
Concave mirrors form images based on the object’s position relative to its
focus (F) and center of curvature (C).
1. Object at infinity: Image is formed at F, point-sized, real, and inverted.
2. Object beyond C: Image between F and C, smaller, real, and inverted.
3. Object at C: Image at C, same size, real, and inverted.
4. Object between F and C: Image beyond C, larger, real, and inverted.
5. Object at F: Image at infinity, highly enlarged, real, and inverted.
6. Object between P and F: Image behind the mirror, larger, virtual, and
erect.
Ray diagrams involve:
Ray parallel to the principal axis reflects through F.
Ray through C reflects back on itself.
Ray through F reflects parallel.
Ray incident at pole follows angle of incidence = angle of reflection.
This topic is essential for understanding the functioning of concave
reflectors in torches, headlights, and shaving mirrors.

187. Draw and explain the image formation in a convex lens for all object
positions. Write characteristics of each image.
-----------------------------
Answer:
A convex lens forms different types of images depending on object
placement:
1. Object at infinity: Image at focus (F₂), point-sized, real, and inverted.
2. Object beyond 2F₁: Image between F₂ and 2F₂, diminished, real, and
inverted.
3. Object at 2F₁: Image at 2F₂, same size, real, and inverted.
4. Object between F₁ and 2F₁: Image beyond 2F₂, magnified, real, and
inverted.
5. Object at F₁: Image at infinity, highly magnified, real, and inverted.
6. Object between optical centre and F₁: Image behind lens, magnified,
virtual, and erect.
Each ray diagram includes:
A ray parallel to principal axis refracts through F₂.
A ray through optical centre passes undeviated.
A ray through F₁ emerges parallel.
These principles are used in magnifiers, cameras, projectors, and human
eyes.

188. A concave lens always forms a virtual, erect and diminished image.
Explain with reasons and a diagram. Mention its applications.
-----------------------------
Answer:
A concave lens is a diverging lens and forms images that are always
virtual, erect, and diminished, regardless of object distance.
Ray behavior:
A ray parallel to the principal axis appears to diverge from focus
after refraction.
A ray passing through the optical centre goes undeviated.
Since refracted rays diverge, they do not meet; they only appear to
diverge from a point. Thus, the image formed is always virtual
(cannot be captured on screen), upright, and smaller.

Peepholes in doors
Combination with convex lenses in optical devices

189. Assertion (A): A concave mirror is used in solar cookers.
Reason (R): Concave mirrors can diverge light rays falling on them.
Choose the correct option and justify your answer.
A) Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explanation of A
B) Both A and R are true, but R is not the correct explanation of A
C) A is true but R is false
D) A is false but R is true
-----------------------------
Answer:
Correct option: C) A is true but R is false
Concave mirrors are used in solar cookers because they converge parallel
rays of sunlight to a single point – the focus. This concentration of light
increases the temperature, allowing cooking of food. The reason is
incorrect because concave mirrors do not diverge light; convex mirrors do.
The ability of a concave mirror to focus energy at one point makes it
suitable for solar applications.

190. Assertion (A): A virtual image can never be obtained on a screen.
Reason (R): A virtual image is formed by converging light rays at a point.
Choose the correct option and justify your answer.
A) Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explanation of A
B) Both A and R are true, but R is not the correct explanation of A
C) A is true but R is false
D) A is false but R is true
-----------------------------
Answer:
Correct option: C) A is true but R is false
Virtual images cannot be captured on screens because they are not
formed by actual convergence of rays. Instead, they are formed by the
apparent divergence of rays. The rays do not meet; they only appear to do
so when extended backward. Thus, the image appears behind the mirror or
lens and cannot be projected. The assertion is correct, but the reason is
wrong.

191. A torch uses a concave mirror, while a car’s rearview mirror is
convex. Justify the use of each mirror with image properties.
-----------------------------
Answer:
A torch uses a concave mirror to produce a strong, parallel beam of light.
The bulb is placed at the focus, and the concave surface reflects the
diverging light rays into parallel rays. This creates a concentrated beam for
long-distance visibility.
In contrast, a rearview mirror in vehicles is convex. It always forms virtual,
erect, and diminished images. Its wider field of view allows the driver to see
more of the road and reduces blind spots. Though the image is smaller, it is
more informative. Convex mirrors do not form real images and cannot
focus light.
Thus, concave mirrors are used for focused light projection, and convex
mirrors for broad field visibility.

192. Explain how the lens formula is derived and how it helps in
understanding image position in lenses. Give an example.
-----------------------------
Answer:
The lens formula is:
1/f = 1/v – 1/u, where:
f = focal length of the lens
v = image distance from optical centre
u = object distance from optical centre
The sign convention used is similar to mirrors:
All distances are measured from the optical centre.
Distances toward the left are negative, to the right are positive.
The formula is derived using geometry and the laws of refraction. It
helps calculate the unknown image or object distance, given two of
the three quantities.
Example: A convex lens of focal length 15 cm forms an image at 30
cm. Find the object position.
1/f = 1/v – 1/u → 1/15 = 1/30 – 1/u → 1/u = 1/30 – 1/15 = –1/30 → u = –30
cm
So, object is 30 cm left of the lens.

193. A convex lens of focal length 20 cm forms an image at 30 cm from the
lens. Find the object distance, image type, and magnification. Explain
your answer with reasoning.
-----------------------------
Answer:
Given: f = +20 cm, v = +30 cm
Using lens formula: 1/f = 1/v – 1/u
1/20 = 1/30 – 1/u → 1/u = 1/30 – 1/20 = (2 – 3)/60 = –1/60 → u = –60 cm
Object is 60 cm left of the lens.
Magnification (m) = v/u = 30/(–60) = –0.5
The negative magnification indicates that the image is real and inverted.
The magnitude (0.5) shows that it is diminished. The convex lens, when the
object is beyond 2F, produces a real, inverted and smaller image between
F and 2F.

194. Why does a pencil appear broken when immersed in water at an
angle? Justify the observation using ray diagrams and concept of
refraction.
-----------------------------
Answer:
The broken appearance of a pencil in water is due to refraction. Light rays
coming from the submerged part of the pencil pass from water to air.
Since water is optically denser, the rays bend away from the normal as
they enter air. The brain traces the rays back in a straight line, making the
pencil appear at a higher position. This apparent shift creates the illusion of
a broken or bent pencil.
A ray diagram shows:
Incident ray from the pencil under water
Refracted ray bending away
Apparent position above real position
This is a common everyday example of refraction at work.

195. A student observes the Sun’s image on a paper through a convex
lens and burns the paper. Explain the scientific principle, safety
precautions and energy conversion involved.
-----------------------------
Answer:
When parallel rays from the Sun fall on a convex lens, they converge at the
focus. If a sheet of paper is placed at this point, the light energy is
concentrated and can generate enough heat to ignite the paper. This
demonstrates the converging property of convex lenses. The energy
conversion involved is from solar (light) energy to heat energy.
Safety precautions:
Do not look at the Sun directly through the lens.
Avoid prolonged exposure of skin to focused light.
Conduct the experiment outdoors in daylight.
This principle is used in solar cookers and concentrators for eco-
friendly heating.

196. Justify why concave mirrors are used by ENT doctors during ear and
nose examinations. Explain the physics behind this application.
-----------------------------
Answer:
ENT specialists use concave mirrors because of their ability to form virtual,
erect, and magnified images when the object is placed between the
mirror's pole and focus. The mirror reflects the light from a head-mounted
source onto the specific part of the patient’s body being examined —
usually the ear, nose, or throat.
The concave mirror not only concentrates the light onto a small area
(focusing property) but also allows the doctor to see an enlarged, upright
image of the affected region.
Because the mirror is mounted with a central hole (for the doctor's eye), it
combines illumination and magnification. The image appears behind the
mirror, making internal structures more visible without distortion.
This setup improves precision in diagnosis and treatment. Unlike convex
mirrors, concave mirrors can form real or virtual images, making them
versatile for medical use.

197. Justify why an object submerged in water appears to be raised.
Derive the relation between real and apparent depth.
-----------------------------
Answer:
An object under water appears raised because of refraction at the water–
air interface. Light rays coming from the object bend away from the
normal as they move from water (denser) to air (rarer).
Due to this, the brain traces the refracted rays in a straight line backward,
perceiving the object at a shallower depth — this is called apparent depth.
The relationship is:
Apparent depth / Real depth = 1 / Refractive index
So, if the refractive index of water is 4/3 and real depth is 12 cm, the object
appears at 9 cm.
This phenomenon has practical implications in activities like spearfishing,
where one has to aim below the apparent position of the fish to hit the real
target.
It also explains why swimming pool bottoms look closer than they are.

198. Justify the use of a convex mirror in ATMs and elevators. How does its
geometry help in practical situations?
-----------------------------
Answer:
Convex mirrors are used in ATMs, elevators, and hallways because they
provide a wide field of view. Their outward-curved surface reflects light
rays in such a way that they appear to diverge from a point behind the
mirror.
This results in the formation of virtual, erect, and diminished images —
though smaller, they cover a larger area.
This allows users and security personnel to monitor surroundings and
check for safety, especially in blind corners.
Due to the mirror's geometry, even a small convex mirror can display wide-
angle views, making it ideal for areas with limited space.
The image is not distorted and allows real-time monitoring of people
approaching or standing nearby.
In elevators, these mirrors help passengers see who is behind them,
reducing risks and improving security.

199. Justify the role of refraction in designing lenses for optical
instruments like telescopes and microscopes.
-----------------------------
Answer:
Refraction is the key principle in the functioning of optical instruments such
as microscopes, telescopes, cameras, and magnifiers. When light passes
from one medium to another (e.g., air to glass), it changes direction — this
is refraction.
In a convex lens, parallel rays converge at the focus, forming real, inverted
images which can be projected or magnified.
In microscopes, two or more convex lenses are used: the objective lens
forms a real image which is magnified again by the eyepiece.
In telescopes, lenses or mirrors gather distant light and refract it to form a
real image, which is magnified.
This is possible only because the materials (glass/plastic) are optically
denser, allowing light to slow down and bend inside them.
Careful design using the lens maker’s formula and understanding of
refraction allows accurate image formation and magnification.

200. Justify why the image of the sun formed by a convex lens on a paper
is real and inverted. How does the lens behave in this context?
-----------------------------
Answer:
The Sun’s rays are effectively parallel when they reach the Earth due to its
large distance. When these rays pass through a convex lens, they converge
at the principal focus, forming a real image on the paper.
This real image is inverted (though the Sun appears circular) and can even
burn the paper due to energy concentration.
The lens in this scenario is acting as a converging lens, converting parallel
rays into focused rays meeting at a point.
The image is visible because the light rays actually meet at the focal point.
This principle is also applied in solar concentrators, which use convex
lenses to convert solar energy into heat energy.
Such real images can only be captured on a screen, proving their physical
existence.
